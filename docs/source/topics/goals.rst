Goals
===============

-  To aid developers getting involved with `OpenStack`_!
-  To quickly build developer `OpenStack`_ environments in a clean
   environment (as well as start, stop, and uninstall those
   environments) with as little baggage as possible.
-  To describe working configurations of `OpenStack`_.

   -  Which code branches work together?
   -  What do config files look like for those branches?
   -  What packages are needed for installation for a given
      distribution?

-  To make it easier for developers to dive into `OpenStack`_ so that
   they can productively contribute without having to understand every
   part of the system at once.
-  To make it easy to prototype cross-project features.
-  To have an installer that works!
